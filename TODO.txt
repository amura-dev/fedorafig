--- Instead of making the user choose the repo by name, they should choose by 
    repo file name, as the real repo name is specified in the repo file.
    The reason specifying the repo name works right now is because I have, in
    my configs, assumed that the repo name is what is the name of the repo
    file without the `.repo`. But I am wrong. That is only the base file
    name, not the repo name. Getting the repo name would require iterating
    over the repo file until the name is found.

--- Moving repos into `/tmp/fedorafig/` is NOT redundant because sometimes you
    want to activate all part of the repositories, but if you select the
    `reposdir` to be the `repos` directory, then all repos that could
    possibly be used will be used. However, IT IS redundant to move all the
    repo file to `/tmp/fedorafig/` when `all` repos are specified, because
    only then can you specify that the `reposdir` should be `repos`. But this requires extra code, but in this code extra code is better because it
    results in less disk operations, resulting in a faster program. Many repos
    too actually, where extra repos can be used as fallback repos.

--- Currently, you can only add one of each subkey to each entry. There should
    be an option to specify multiple packages, syspaths, and scripts. Multiple
    packages because you might want to group them if you are installing all of
    them for one particular purpose. Multiple syspaths to copy the configs
    into multiple directories if needed. Multiple scripts, for the same reason
    as multiple packages per entry.

STATUS: Unresolved.
--- Code appears to be poorly written. I do not like its appearance and patterns.
